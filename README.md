# water-quality
 
 This code relates to the thesis project topic _Development of an Open-Source Real-Time Water Quality Monitoring Device: A Modular Approach_.

 **General Notes:**

 - I prefer to track issues here instead of in a document. I also use PlatformIO w/ Visual Studio Code to compile,
 although I use Arduino IDE to troubleshoot any difficulties related to the development platform (which is rare).
